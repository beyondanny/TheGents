<b>About</b><br><b>THE GENTS:</b><br>
Long ago, random highschool students sought out to graduate from the depths of a generic highschool. Wave after wave of the highschool days, their graduation date came about, thus graduating as the Class of 2019. In the same year, a couple months after graduation, they all went to the same community college in order to pursue their own degrees. 1 day, a random gent saw a group of people talking on the cafe table, thus beginning the start of something new. From their mischievous adventures of wandering the halls, to cracking jokes that go too far, to even making the dumbest of mistakes, it is evident this isn't the perfect group, but what makes this group the best group all comes down to 1 word: diversity. We all aim for something so different. So join us, as we become on of the best groups of all time: THE GENTS! <br>
