# TheGents
A friendly user site for The GENTS
The original purpose of this site was a prank site for my friends. However, its now time for a change. I intend to recreate this page as a type of forum page for any open discussion about various topics. To form a community in which we will discuss upon various things, for all users to becomme The GENTS of the Nation.

I created this using Notepad ++, and the whole idea for the design was to give it a tropical theme for a more "Chilling" experience.

If you would like to view the site, you may download the files and launch them using Notepad ++, dont forget the CSS!

I hope you enjoy my current site and let me know for any changes!
